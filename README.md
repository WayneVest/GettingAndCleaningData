# GettingAndCleaningData
Programming assignment for the Johns Hopkins Getting And Cleaning Data course.

The script in this repo is designed to create a tidy data set from the data obtained at this URI: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Once the data is tidy, a new data set is derived that contains fewer observations, which represent the means of the tidied original data, on a per-subject, per-activity basis.

For your convenience, there is only one script (run_analysis.R - here: ), which will automatically run when sourced.
